# Product Guidelines - PastePaw

## Design Philosophy
- **Modern Minimalist:** PastePaw prioritizes a clean, uncluttered interface. Use generous whitespace, clear typography, and subtle animations to provide a premium, high-performance feel.
- **Visual Consistency:** Maintain a unified aesthetic across Windows and macOS while respecting platform-specific nuances (e.g., translucency effects like Acrylic/Mica on Windows and Vibrancy on macOS).

## Prose & Communication
- **Professional & Concise:** All user-facing text should be direct and brief. Avoid unnecessary jargon or conversational filler.
- **Instructional Clarity:** Tooltips and settings descriptions must provide immediate value, helping the user understand "why" a feature exists or "how" to use it in one sentence or less.

## User Feedback & Interactions
- **Non-Intrusive Feedback:** Use auto-dismissing toast notifications for common background tasks (e.g., "Copied to clipboard"). These should inform the user without breaking their focus.
- **Fluid Transitions:** Every interaction, from window toggling to list scrolling, must be smooth and performant. Avoid jarring UI jumps or heavy loading states.
- **Contextual Actions:** Prioritize right-click menus and keyboard shortcuts for advanced operations, keeping the main interface focused on the clipboard history.
