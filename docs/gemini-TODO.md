## TODO

macOS:
[x] show main window on active window when pressing the hotkey
[x] show main window above system Dock(macOS)
[x] auto paste to active input window when double clicking the clip card,Remember to use technologies permitted by the App Store and Sandbox, as I may want to list the app on the App Store later.
[x] add round cornors for setting windows, make it more native looks and feel
[x] grab application name where the clipboard content comes from, and its icon, then set them on the top of clip card
[x] Adjust the window size to maintain a small gap with the bottom edge of the screen. It should essentially cover the current Dock on macOS.
[ ] make main window (clip card list window) more native looks and feel
[ ] submit to app store
